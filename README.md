# Spot_assistant
Voice controlled spot assistant that understands and speaks Lithuanian

This project was made in collaboration with Rubedo sistemos for my internship task.
The project is built on top of spot wasd code. For more information https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/tree/master/python/examples/wasd

spot_speak.py file is only for chatting and spot_control.py file is for both voice control and chatting.
